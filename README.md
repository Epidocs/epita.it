## Hosting your own project

### Get an EPITA.it subdomain for your project

If you are hosting a project and would like to use an EPITA.it subdomain for it, you can ask [@matiboux](https://github.com/matiboux) for one.

For example, you can ask that I point `yourawesomeproject.epita.it` to Github Pages or to your web server so you can use it for your project. We'll discuss your request and if okay, we'll set that up together.

You can contact [@matiboux](https://github.com/matiboux) via an issue on Github, or privately via Telegram or Discord.
