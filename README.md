### Add links

Links in the web portal are managed in YAML files, located in [`app/app/src/data/`](app/app/src/data/). You can add links to a specific page by editing the corresponding `.yml` file.

For example, if you want to update links on the home page, you can edit [`app/app/src/data/links.yml`](app/app/src/data/links.yml).

Please note the order of items determines how links are displayed on the website.


## Hosting your own project

EPITA.it does not offer hosting services, but can help you find resources to build and publish your project.

### Get an EPITA.it subdomain for your project

You can request to use an EPITA.it subdomain for your project, given that it is related to EPITA or the EPITA community.

For example, you can request a subdomain like `yourawesomeproject.epita.it` and have it point to your web server or service provider (like GitHub Pages) for serving your project.

To make this request, you can open an issue here or contact [@matiboux](https://github.com/matiboux) directly via Telegram or Discord. We'll discuss your request, project, and help you move forward if everything looks good!
